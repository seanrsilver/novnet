Description: NovNet includes tools and utilities associated with the Novel Networks Project at Rutgers.  Novel Networks compiles name-normalized digital texts of eighteenth-century novels (ca. 1650-1850).  Name-normalization means that all character proper names are associated with a single unique name, making possible the extraction of character token networks.  NovNet also includes a number of user-friendly, out-of-the-box tools to generate graph and network-type visualizations.
